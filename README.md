Europe Sales Records Analysis Python Dashboard:

This project showcases my ability to create interactive and insightful data visualizations using Python, enhancing decision-making processes through data analysis. We are excited to share this project with you all on LinkedIn.

This dashboard includes the click data, hover data, dropdowns, date range selectors, radio buttons, and maps with click-and-select features.
Interactive features between charts and their functions.
CSS selectors style the app, providing a polished and professional appearance.

Through this dashboard, we can conclude several key insights about sales performance and profitability across European countries, helping inform strategic business decisions.

Dashboard Tabs and Features that we have done is:

    Introduction Tab:
        Shows the Overview of the dataset and the goals of the analysis.

    In the Profit & Trends Tab:
        Line graph displaying performance over time for total revenue, total cost, and total profit, with the year on the x-axis. This helps conclude whether the revenue, cost, and profit increase or decrease over the years.

    In the Sales Performance Tab:
        Scatter plot showing the correlation between units sold and total profit, total revenue, and total cost.

    In the Sales by Country:
        Bar graph for item types vs. units sold. When a specific country is selected on the map, the bar graph shows which item types are sold more or less in that country.

    Finally in the Priority & Profits Tab:
        Pie chart displaying item types with their percentages. Clicking on an item type in the pie chart updates the line graph to show the total profit and total revenue for that item type over the years.
